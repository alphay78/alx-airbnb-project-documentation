# Airbnb Clone Backend â€“ User Stories

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder contains the **user stories** for the Airbnb Clone backend project. User stories translate the use case diagram interactions into clear, actionable requirements that guide backend development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal is to capture the core functionalities and interactions of the system from a user perspective. Each story follows the format:

> As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit].

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `user-stories.md`: Contains detailed user stories for all primary and secondary interactions, including user management, property management, bookings, payments, reviews, notifications, and admin operations.

## ðŸ”— Purpose
These user stories serve as a bridge between **system design** (use case diagrams) and **implementation**, helping developers understand what needs to be built and why.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps
- Implement features in accordance with the documented user stories.
- Use the stories to guide **API development**, **database design**, and **system testing**.
